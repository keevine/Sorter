# Binary sorter

Don't know the exact order you'd rank all 23 Marvel movies? 

Me neither since keeping track of all 23 is hard. 
This sorter takes in a .txt file of anything you like (such as all 23 Marvel movies) and only asks you to compare 
two at a time to make your sorting decisions easier. After answering all the questions it'll display the exact order 
without you having to keep track of everything yourself.

Uses a binary search tree data structure to optimise the comparisons and minimise the number of questions asked.
